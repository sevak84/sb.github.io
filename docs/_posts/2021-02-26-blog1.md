## Creating VPC 

- VPC which stands for virtual private cloud actually is the virtual version of a physical network. VPC is configurable pool of shared resources allocated within a public cloud environment, providing a certain level of isolation between the different organizations using the resources.
- What is VPC used for? enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS. 


## Create an internet gateway and attach it to the VPC
To be able to connect the VPC toe the internet we need to have a gateway to allow the communication between the VPC and the internet. 
An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in the VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses.

To enable communication over the internet for IPv4, the instance must have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address that's associated with a private IPv4 address on the instance. The instance is only aware of the private (internal) IP address space defined within the VPC and subnet. The internet gateway logically provides the one-to-one NAT on behalf of the instance, so that when traffic leaves the VPC subnet and goes to the internet, the reply address field is set to the public IPv4 address or Elastic IP address of the instance, and not its private IP address. Conversely, traffic that's destined for the public IPv4 address or Elastic IP address of the instance has its destination address translated into the instance's private IPv4 address before the traffic is delivered to the VPC. 

## Create two availability zones in two different regions 

Why we need to have two zones? 
Each AWS Region is subdivided into separate Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has its own power, cooling, and network connectivity and thus forms an isolated failure domain. 


## Create a public and a private subnet in each zone

A private subnet used for that reason that two zones connect to each other privatey with out internet gateway attached and have secure connection like SSH tunnel. A public subnet  has a public IP address and an internet gateway is attached to it that allows communication between the instance for the subnet and the internet and other AWS services. An instance in a private subnet has a private IP address and a network address translation (NAT) gateway is used to send traffic back and forth between the instance for the subnet and the internet and other AWS services. The NAT gateway must be hosted in a public subnet. Public subnets Note Even if the instance for the environment is launched in a private subnet, the VPC must feature at least one public subnet. 

## Create a NAT gateway in each public subnet 

NAT gateway is network address translation (NAT), which provides outbound internet access to instances in a private subnets, but prevent the internet from accessing those instances. But for public subnet it has to be connected to the route table which has route to the internet gateway and can communicate with internet and is accessible through public ip address.
