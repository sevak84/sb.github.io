## Slack will soon let users DM people in other organizations 

Users of Slack’s Connect service will be able to contact individuals at separate organizations, another step in the team chat company's efforts to replace email in the workplace.

Slack has taken another step in its efforts to replace email, adding the ability to send direct messages between users in separate organizations.

The company has been pushing the concept of intercompany communications for a while, first with the introduction of shared channels in 2017 that lets two companies create chat groups for shared projects and more recently with the launch of Slack Connect in June.

The product of extensive re-architecting of Slack’s underlying technology, Connect essentially expanded the reach of shared channels, with support for conversations between employees at many more organizations. It’s an approach that has proved popular: there are now 52,000 organizations working in Slack Connect using 100,000 shared channels.

At the launch of Connect, Slack promised that users would eventually be able to quickly and securely send direct messages to staff in other organizations, too. The idea is that, having already reduced the need for internal emails between co-workers, Slack’s wants to do the same for intercompany communications.

At its Frontiers virtual event Tuesday, Slack announced that Connect Direct Messages are due to launch in early 2021. By sharing a private invite link with an individual such as a client or customer at a “trusted” organization, two users can exchange direct messages.

“Slack Connect is our answer to fully replacing email,” said Brad Mattick, vice president of product marketing at Slack. “The idea [with Connect DMs] is that it's easy and quick to send a note to a partner, vendor or an agency that one is working with.”

Currently, the majority of external communications is still largely done via email or personal texting, said Irwin Lazar, vice president and service director at Nemertes Research.
