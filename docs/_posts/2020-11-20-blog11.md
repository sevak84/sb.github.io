# What is the "Static site generator"? 


Static site generators are applications that you can run on the command line (or potentially through some other UI) to compile a website from simpler source files. For example, you might have various files defining a layout, some “include” files (containing re-usable content), a configuration file, and your Markdown content files.

The static site generator reads your configuration file and pushes your content into the layout files, adds whatever includes are referenced (such as a sidebar or footer or re-used snippets), and writes out the HTML pages from the Markdown sources. Each page usually has the sidebar and other navigation included directly into the page (pre-built), as well as all the other layout code you’ve defined, ready for viewing online.

Additionally, static site generators can be used programmatically in build scripts that are run as part of a process on a server. This allows them to be leveraged in continuous delivery processes that are triggered by a particular event, such as a commit to a particular branch in a version control repository, or as part of a script.

With a regular content management system (CMS) like WordPress, content is stored in a separate database and dynamically pulled from the database to the web page on each user visit. Static site generators don’t have databases — all the content is on the page already, and nothing is dynamically assembled on the fly through PHP or other server-side scripting. All the pages on a static site were built prior to the browser’s request, enabling an instantaneous response; nothing changes dynamically based on the user’s profile (unless done with client-side JS).


There are some famous static site generators such as; Jekyll, Hugo, and Sphinx. The static site generator builds the all files for your website, pushing Markdown files into the layouts you define, running scripts to automate logic you need and more as they generate out HTML files.
