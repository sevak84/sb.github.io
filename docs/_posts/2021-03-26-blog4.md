## BMI Calculator:  
The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding weight status while taking age into consideration. Use the "Metric Units" tab for the International System of Units or the "Other Units" tab to convert units into either US or metric units. Note that the calculator also computes the Ponderal Index in addition to BMI, both of which are discussed below in detail.

## BMI introduction

BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that is used by the calculator.

Adding more API to the website using EDAMAM 

Edamam has built over time three complementary APIs to serve a number of use cases by developers or businesses needing rich and accurate nutrition data. Its Nutrition Analysis API offers real-time, highly accurate nutrition analysis and diet tagging of any recipe or ingredient list. The Food Database API provides access to over 750,000 foods, including generic and branded foods, restaurant items and commonly eaten meals. The Recipe Search API, built on top of a database of 5 million nutritionally tagged and analyzed recipes, makes it very easy to build nutrient and diet driven meal recommendation solutions.
