## Creating "Security Groups"

A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. When you launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups. security groups enable you to manage network access to your Amazon RDS instances. With security groups, you specify sets of IP addresses using CIDR notation, and only network traffic originating from these addresses is recognized by your Amazon RDS instance.

## Creating NAT Gateways 

Network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances

## Elastic IP address (EIP)

Elastic IP address is a public static IPv4 address which is reachable from the Internet. Basically Elastic IP addresses are used by AWS to manage its dynamic cloud computing services. Within the AWS infrastructure, customers have virtual private clouds (VPC), within the VPCs, users have instances

## Route tables

A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed

## Elastic load balancer 

Elastic Load Balancing scales traffic to an application as demand changes over time. ... As elastic load balancing uses request routing algorithms to distribute incoming application traffic across multiple instances or scale them as necessary, it increases the fault tolerance of your applications
